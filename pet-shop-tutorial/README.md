## Learned stages 

### Developing the Smart Contracts

   All parts must be in their respective folders for truffle to perform the desired
   operation.
  
  -The local test blockchain must be up and running 
       
       testrpc

  -Compile the smart contracts:
  
      truffle compile
      
  -Migrate using JS:  
  
      truffle migrate 
      
  -Execute the solidity/JS tests: 
  
      truffle test 

### Serving the Smart Contracts using Web3

   'dev' is an alias for 'lite-server'
   -Start up the lite-server so that localhost:3000 shows the DApp
        
        npm run dev
